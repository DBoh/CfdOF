# CfdOF: A Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) workbench for FreeCAD

The workbench serves as a front-end (GUI) for the popular OpenFOAM® CFD toolkit (www.openfoam.org, www.openfoam.com).

## Roadmap

The following features are being considered for addition to the Workbench. There are also a number of extensions to
existing features which will be considered, such as inclusion of compressible variants of the standard turbulence modes 
to ensure the correct formulations are used with the selected solver. 

This document is primarily for documenting new features by the developers but is published for the information of users. 

## New features
### Turbulence models
* k-epsilon 
* Spalart Allmaras
* Langtry's transition models for k-omega

### Mesh
* checkMesh capabilities
